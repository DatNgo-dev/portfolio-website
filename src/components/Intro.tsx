        I come from a biomedical science background with a career in laboratory
        technician. Although I&apos;ve enjoyed my work, I&apos;ve realized that my true
        passion lies in software development. I love the challenge of solving
        complex problems and the sense of satisfaction that comes from creating
        something that works.
        <br /> <br />I found that I enjoyed the technical aspects of software
        development more than the biomedical side, and that&apos;s what ultimately
        led me to pursue this new field. I&apos;m excited to bring my skills and
        experience to a new role where I can focus on developing software and
        applications that make a difference in people&apos;s lives.
